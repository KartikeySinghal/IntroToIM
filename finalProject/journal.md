# Journal for the Final Project

### Preliminary Concept

 I would like to recreate those drawing tablets called Etch-a-sketch where the user uses 2 knobs to move a pointer across the slate and thus draw any shape. I plan to use 2 potentiometers(will have to borrow one lol) along with some buttons that provide addition functionality like clearing the drawing space and maybe changing colours and/or saving a screenshot of the image

### Inspiration:

#### 9th December:
It took some time but I finally was able to get a second potentiometer for my project. These 2 potentiometers will act as knobs to draw on the drawing space. Today I just worked on the Arduino side of things with making the circuit and inputting values from both the potentiometers into Serial.
