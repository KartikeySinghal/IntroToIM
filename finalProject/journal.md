# Preliminary Concept

### I would like to recreate those drawing tablets called Etch-a-sketch where the user uses 2 knobs to move a pointer across the slate and thus draw any shape. I plan to use 2 potentiometers(will have to borrow one lol) along with some buttons that provide addition functionality like clearing the drawing space and maybe changing colours and/or saving a screenshot of the image
