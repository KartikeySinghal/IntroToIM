# Journal for the Midterm Project

### Idea: For the midterm project, I intent to recreate the astroid destroyer game. It will have a ship, flying over an endlessley genereated terrain, and controled by the users' keyboard inputs(W,S,A,D). The game appearance of astroid/ther movement speed of the ship will increase linearly with time making it more difficullt as time by. I might add 2-3 lives for the user at a cost for points

### Objective: Destroy as many astroids as possible without dying
