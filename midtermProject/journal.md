# Journal for the Midterm Project

### Idea: 
For the midterm project, I intent to recreate the astroid destroyer game. It will have a ship, flying over an endlessley genereated terrain, and controled by the users' keyboard inputs(W,S,A,D). The game appearance of astroid/ther movement speed of the ship will increase linearly with time making it more difficullt as time by. I might add 2-3 lives for the user at a cost for points

### Objective:
Destroy as many astroids as possible without dying

### Inspiration:

#### 24th October:
Since I was working on the project before making the journal, I added the progress I made so far. It inlcudes an infinite terrain generated using perlin noise and a ship. Both of these were made using beginShape-endShape. I also implemented the movement of the ship using W,S,A,D keys
