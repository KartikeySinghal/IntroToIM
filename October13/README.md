# Assignment5

For Assignment 5, rather than making something specific I wanted to experiment with Image processing in an unconventional way that still sort of preserves the original image
This was the end result:

I ended up using perlin noise and a function called lerpColor() that calculates a color between two colors at a specific increment. Both of these produce a throbbing effect
that almost looks like the image is breathing
